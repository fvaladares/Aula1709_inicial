3. Insert the hint at the respective edittext
4. The left button should be renamed to Calculate, and the second ond to Clear
5. When the user click on Calculate button, a new activity should appear, showing the result of the BMI (body mass index) -- chek here how to calculate: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Dndice_de_massa_corporal
5.1 The result Activity should show: the BMI index, the situation and some recomendation. Be creative ;)

Share your project with the professor using your github account.

Recomendations:
1. Use constraint layout.
2. Don't forget to set the valus as string - we do not want problems with the intents hehehe :)
3. Try to add some colors to your project :)
